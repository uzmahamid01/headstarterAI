						<p>I'm Uzma Hamid, Computer Science Student at Texas A&M. 
							I am a Software Developer and tech enthusiast. My interest in this field was sparked at a 
							young age when my dad bought our first computer. During high school, I delved into self-taught 
							coding which led to a passion that has grown stronger over time.  I'm deeply committed to leveraging technology for 
							positive social impact, and I'm particularly fascinated by AI/ML and the intersection of 
							technology and different fields. I have a passion for exploring different algorithms and their 
							potential to address profound societal challenges. During my time in college, I interned at STAIR Stanford University as a 
							AI/ML Researcher focusing on domain generalization in ML and I have led a 
							Computer Vision research initiative focusing on image/object detection and semantic 
							segmentation. Outside work and academics, I enjoy reading,
							 photography, and exploring the beautiful world.<p>

								<h3>Accuracy of the Line</h3>
								<!-- <p>Develop and validate domain generalization benchmarks by ensuring construct validity, selecting diverse datasets, applying theoretical frameworks, and conducting empirical evaluations to create robust benchmarks with minimal or negative correlations between in-domain and out-of-domain accuracies.</p> -->
								<p>
									Conducted the research that explores the relationship between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracies in machine learning models. Contrary to the common belief that high ID accuracy ensures similar OOD performance, our study reveals cases where this does not hold, highlighting the "Accuracy on the Negative Line" (AOTNL) phenomenon. By using advanced neural networks and experimental analysis, we demonstrate the challenges of model generalization across varying data distributions, underscoring the need for better benchmarks that reflect real-world complexities.
