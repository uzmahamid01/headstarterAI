								<h3>Accuracy of the Line</h3>
								<!-- <p>Develop and validate domain generalization benchmarks by ensuring construct validity, selecting diverse datasets, applying theoretical frameworks, and conducting empirical evaluations to create robust benchmarks with minimal or negative correlations between in-domain and out-of-domain accuracies.</p> -->
								<p>
									Conducted the research that explores the relationship between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracies in machine learning models. Contrary to the common belief that high ID accuracy ensures similar OOD performance, our study reveals cases where this does not hold, highlighting the "Accuracy on the Negative Line" (AOTNL) phenomenon. By using advanced neural networks and experimental analysis, we demonstrate the challenges of model generalization across varying data distributions, underscoring the need for better benchmarks that reflect real-world complexities.

								<h3>Image Processing and Annotation Pipeline</h3>
                                <p>Computer Vision research initiative focused on image detection, object detection, and semantic segmentation, resulting in the development of a sophisticated fine-grain annotation tool using Python. The project incorporated algorithms for contour detection, polygon approximation, and image manipulation, and the research findings were presented at the CCSC in March 2022 in collaboration with Penn State University. The primary goal was to address file format incompatibility in pixel-wise annotation, aiming to assist visually impaired individuals and contribute to advancements in the AI branch of computer vision. The tool, seamlessly integrated with Label Studio, successfully annotates images from scratch with different polygons and refines existing annotations from benchmark datasets with more fine-grained semantic categories, showcasing its significance in improving accessibility and pushing the boundaries of computer vision capabilities.</p>

								<h3>Deep Learning Based Object Grasping for Robots</h3>
                                <p>Directed and spearheaded an innovative research endeavor focused on advancing the field of image segmentation for table-top objects through the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Our comprehensive approach involved the development and meticulous implementation of a cutting-edge deep learning-based object grasping model. This pioneering model exhibited a remarkable 30% enhancement in the success rate of robotic systems' grasping capabilities, underscoring its efficacy in real-world scenarios. In order to fortify the model's performance, rigorous testing and training were conducted using the OCID (Object Clutter Indoor Dataset) and OSD (Object Segmentation Dataset), resulting in a substantial improvement in robustness. The fine-tuning process not only bolstered the model's accuracy but also contributed significantly to a commendable 25% reduction in false positives during object recognition. This multifaceted research initiative not only showcases advancements in image segmentation and object grasping but also underscores the practical implications of our work in bolstering the reliability and precision of robotic systems in complex environments.</p>

								<h3>Hack Harvard: Globe Climate News</h3>
                                <p>The project, named findEarth, is an innovative and interactive globe designed to provide users with current, curated, and summarized news specifically centered around climate change and tailored to locations of individual interest. The frontend of the application dynamically tracks the user's finger movements on the screen, sending the corresponding geo-location data to the backend. The backend, set up in a Spring Boot environment, orchestrates a sequence of operations that involve querying the newsapi.org API to aggregate global news. Leveraging location-based intelligent search, the system identifies the top 20 most relevant articles, which are further refined through the application of OpenAI's GPT. The backend logic encompasses querying, mapping responses, and utilizing teammate-developed API calls to interact with GPT 3.5, instructing it to choose the most pertinent article URL from the newsapi.org results. The selected article is then downloaded, summarized, and promptly presented to the user, allowing them to focus on the climate change news that matters most to them. This seamless integration of front-end and back-end technologies showcases a sophisticated approach to delivering personalized and impactful information on a global scale.</p>
